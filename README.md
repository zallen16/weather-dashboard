# weather-dashboard

This week's assignment tasked us with taking no starter code and creating a simple weather dashboard application to display today's weather with the 5-day forecast as well. We used our knowledge of APIs and fetch to retrieve extensive data on the weather among any US city. 

Help for assignment was given by TAs in program and tutor Juan Delgado.
